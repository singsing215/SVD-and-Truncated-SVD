# SVD-and-Truncated-SVD
1. Calculate the tf-idf feature vectors to obtain the document-to-term matrix
2. Apply truncated SVD to the document-to-term matrix with k=2 to obtain the representation of reduced dimension for each of the documents
3. Convert the query 𝒒={attract, TV, program} to its representation of the reduced dimension
4. Rank the four documents accordingly
